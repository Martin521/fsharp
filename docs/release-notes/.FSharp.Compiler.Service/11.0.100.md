* Redesign #line processing. The original positions (unaffected by #line directives) are now kept in the AST, and `__LINE__` and `__SOURCE_LINE__` show the original line numbers / file names. However, all diagnostics and debug information stays the same (shows the position transformed by the #line directives).
