### Fixed

* Fix parsing errors using anonymous records and units of measures ([PR #18543](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18543))
* Fixed: Allow `return`, `return!`, `yield`, `yield!` type annotations without parentheses ([PR #18533](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18533))
* Allow `let!` and `use!` type annotations without requiring parentheses ([PR #18508](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18508))
* Fix find all references for F# exceptions ([PR #18565](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18565))
* Shorthand lambda: fix completion for chained calls and analysis for unfinished expression ([PR #18560](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18560))

### Breaking Changes

* Simplify creation of `FSharpDiagnostics`. In a few cases, errors without ranges were assigned to the currently checked file, while in other cases they carried an empty range. The latter is now true in all cases. In a few cases, ranges at eof were corrected, while in others they were not. They are now always left uncorrected. This is a prerequisit for [#18553](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/18553). ([PR #18610](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18610)).
